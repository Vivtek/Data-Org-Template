Data-Org-Template

Data::Org::Template is a template engine. I know what you're thinking.
There are probably more template engines in the world than there are
programmers - but this one does some things I specifically need, so
I wrote it loosely based on JSON Template by Andy Chu (which was always
my favorite template framework from a philosophical standpoint).

The two features it has that set it apart from other template engines
are, first, that inserted multiline values retain the indentation of the
field where they were inserted (this makes literate programming much
easier), and second, it plays well with iterators - both as input,
when an Iterator::Records is passed to a list template, and as output,
so that a list template can be expressed from an iterator into a
file without having to buffer the entire textual output in memory.
